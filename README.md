- 👋 Hi, I am a final year student of Computer Science from Karachi, Pakistan.
- 👀 I am learning about web technologies both front-end and back-end. The plan is to become a full-stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to integrate ReactJS with Typescript. I am planning to start learning about back-end technologies such as NodeJS, MongoDB and Express.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Web related Projects that would help me improve my development skills. I am also interested in working for any open-source projects.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email anasjakwani72@gmail.com/ or through my LinkedIn profile LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anas-jakwani/
