- 👋 Hi, I am a final year student of Computer Science from Karachi, Pakistan.
- 👀 I am learning about web technologies both front-end and back-end. The plan is to become a full-stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in Front-end Developer Bootcamp from Scrimba and learning about ReactJS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Web related Projects that would help me improve my development skills. I am also interested in working for any open-source projects.
